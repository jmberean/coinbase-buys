## ⚙️ Configuration

### Portfolio Allocation

Edit the `PORTFOLIO_ALLOCATION` in `cb-v3-websocket.py`:

```python

PORTFOLIO_ALLOCATION = {
    "BTC-USD": 0.50,  # 50%
    "ETH-USD": 0.50,  # 50%
}
```

**Examples**:

```python
# Conservative Portfolio
PORTFOLIO_ALLOCATION = {
    "BTC-USD": 0.70,   # 70%
    "ETH-USD": 0.30,   # 30%
}

# Diversified Portfolio
PORTFOLIO_ALLOCATION = {
    "BTC-USD": 0.40,   # 40%
    "ETH-USD": 0.30,   # 30%
    "SOL-USD": 0.20,   # 20%
    "DOGE-USD": 0.10,  # 10%
}
```

### Trading Parameters

```python
TOTAL_INVESTMENT = 2.00          # Total amount to invest
PENNY_BUFFER = decimal.Decimal('0.01')    # Price buffer for orders
MAX_CHASE_TIME = 300             # Maximum time to chase prices (5 minutes)
MAX_CHASE_ATTEMPTS = 12          # Maximum retry attempts
MIN_API_INTERVAL = 0.5           # Minimum time between API calls
```

## 🚀 Usage

Run the bot:
```bash
python cb-v3-websocket.py
```

**Sample Output**:

## 🔍 How It Works

### 1. WebSocket Connection
- Connects to Coinbase Advanced Trading WebSocket
- Subscribes to ticker data for all configured products
- Maintains real-time market data stream

### 2. Smart Order Placement
- **Tight Spreads (≤2¢)**: Uses mid-spread pricing
- **Normal Spreads**: Uses ask-minus-buffer pricing
- **Post-Only Orders**: Ensures maker fees (lower costs)

### 3. Price Chasing Logic
- Monitors market movements
- Cancels and replaces orders for better prices
- Adapts to `INVALID_LIMIT_PRICE_POST_ONLY` errors
- Maximum chase time and attempt limits

### 4. Fallback Strategy
- Primary: Real-time WebSocket data
- Fallback: REST API calls if WebSocket fails
- Graceful degradation ensures reliability

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Post-Only Orders
- All orders use `post_only=True` for maker fees
- Orders may fail with `INVALID_LIMIT_PRICE_POST_ONLY` - this is normal
- Bot automatically retries with fresh market data
- Ensures you pay maker fees (~0.5%) instead of taker fees (~0.6%)

### Market Conditions
- **Tight spreads** may require multiple attempts
- **Volatile markets** may trigger price chasing
- **Execution time** varies based on market liquidity

### Risk Management
- Bot uses limit orders only (no market orders)
- Respects API rate limits
- Built-in timeouts prevent infinite loops
- Post-only orders prevent unfavorable executions

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"API credentials not found"**
```bash
# Ensure .env file exists with correct credentials
cat .env
```

**"WebSocket timeout"**
- Bot automatically falls back to REST API
- Check internet connection
- Verify API credentials have WebSocket permissions

**"INVALID_LIMIT_PRICE_POST_ONLY errors"**
- This is normal behavior for post-only orders
- Bot automatically retries with fresh data
- Indicates tight market spreads

**"No market data"**
- Verify product symbols are correct (e.g., "BTC-USD")
- Check if products are available for trading
- Ensure API has market data permissions

### Debug Mode

Uncomment debug line in message handler:
```python
# Debug: Print first few messages to see actual structure
print(f"DEBUG MSG: {json.dumps(msg, indent=2)[:200]}...")
```

## 📊 Testing Tools

The repository includes debugging tools:

**WebSocket Timing Test**:
```bash
python websocket-debug.py
```

This tool proves WebSocket latency and helps diagnose connection issues.

## 🔐 Security

- Store API credentials in `.env` file only
- Never commit `.env` to version control
- Use API keys with minimal required permissions
- Consider IP whitelisting in Coinbase settings

## 📈 Performance Tips

1. **Optimal Portfolio Size**: 2-5 products for best performance
2. **Network**: Use stable, low-latency internet connection
3. **Timing**: Avoid trading during extreme volatility
4. **Monitoring**: Watch for rate limit warnings

## 🔄 Customization

### Adding New Products
Simply update `PORTFOLIO_ALLOCATION`:
```python
PORTFOLIO_ALLOCATION = {
    "BTC-USD": 0.30,
    "ETH-USD": 0.30,
    "SOL-USD": 0.20,
    "ADA-USD": 0.20,
}
```

### Adjusting Trading Behavior
Modify parameters in the configuration section:
- `PENNY_BUFFER`: Adjust order pricing aggressiveness
- `MAX_CHASE_TIME`: Change how long to pursue trades
- `SIGNIFICANT_PRICE_MOVE`: Set price movement threshold for order updates
